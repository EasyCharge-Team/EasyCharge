As a traveler, I want to know which charging stations are on my route, so that I can optimize my time during the stops.

As a user, I want to know the activities available near the charging station, so that I can effectively spend my time while I am waiting for recharge.

As a user, I want to be notified of any out of order or inability to recharge, so that I can save time and car's charge.
